title: About Customizing Red Hat Images
---

It turned out to be quite a pain in the ass to customize a `RHEL10` image.
For whatever reason, guest images were able to boot just fine but I could not
get `virt-cusomize` to play nicely with the images - it would always claim that
there was no operating system on the images.

The following links should provide sufficient context around the problem of building
these images.

# Diagnosis

The main problem is the way that the `RHEL` images are packaged as `bootc` guest
operating systems. This means that `virt-customize` cannot extend these images,
but it is possible to extend them using the `bootc-image-builder`.

# Discovery in Composer

It is important to note that the images that composer outputs are not immediately
compatible with `virt-customize`.

But would still function when I ran the playbooks I used for `Debian` minus the
customization step. This is because the image would appear to be in the
so-called `image-mode`. Running `virt-inspector /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-10.0-x86_64-kvm.qcow2`
would print out absolutely nothing, which is strange in comparison to running the
`virt-inspector` against a `debian` image.

### Notes About Image Mode

Image mode is compatible with QEMU - QEMU is the underlying framework for
`openshift`, `libvirt`, and `proxmox` - all of which I use frequently.

### Notes About Bootc

`bootc` is a library used for 'Transactional, in-place OS updates using OCI/Docker
container images'. Along with this, there is the `bootc-image-builder` which
can be run as a container. `bootc` is used to convert container
images into bootable virtual machine images for various platforms.

Further, my observation is that the `bootc-image-builder` configuration is exactly
the configuration used by `composer-cli`. For instance, it is possible to
specify a user like

```toml
[[customizations.user]]
name = "ansible"
password = "ansible"
key = "ssh-ed25519  ...."
groups = ["wheel"]
```

Using roughly this configuration and the `docker-compose.yaml` provided in this
project I managed to cook up a `qcow` image. For whatever reason, the
necessary tools to modify this using `libvirt-customize` has continued to evade
me, so I will just use the `bootc-image-builder` instead.

# Glossary of Helpful Commands

- `virsh` - The primary command used to manage virtualized resources in `qemu`.
- `virt-customize` - The customization command for prebaked (e.g. guest machine)
  disks.
- `virt-filesystems` - This can be used to inspect disks that have been downloaded.
- `qemu-img` - Analysis of various image formats. In my case, especially helpful
  for inspecting `qcow` images.
