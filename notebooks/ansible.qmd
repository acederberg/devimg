# Starting a New Project in VSCode

## Determine Which Kind of Project Is to be Made

To make reusable components for others to use contribute to an existing collection
or create it yourself.

Generally roles should not be kept in the same repo as the playbooks and inventories,
they should be their own repos for sake of reusability.

1. Look for the ansible icon on the left hand side of VSCode and click it.
